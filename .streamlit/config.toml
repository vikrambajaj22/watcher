# Streamlit configuration for Watcher app
# This file sets a default theme so you don't need the three-dot menu to change
# light/dark mode while developing or when the menu is not visible.

[theme]
# options: "dark" or "light"
base = "dark"
primaryColor = "#667eea"
backgroundColor = "#0e1117"
secondaryBackgroundColor = "#111317"
textColor = "#ffffff"
font = "sans serif"

# If you want the default to be light, switch base = "light" and adjust colors.

# Notes:
# - The three-dot menu still controls the UI when Streamlit is run normally in the browser
#   (run with `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`). Some hosting or embed modes hide the
#   menu; this file ensures a theme is applied regardless.
# - To override locally, create ~/.streamlit/config.toml with your preferred settings.
